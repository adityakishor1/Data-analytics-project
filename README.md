# Data Science Project

This repository contains various data science projects focused on applying machine learning algorithms and statistical methods to solve real-world problems. Each project includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model building, and evaluation.

### Key Features:
- Data preprocessing techniques (handling missing data, feature engineering, etc.)
- Exploratory data analysis with visualizations
- Machine learning model development (regression, classification, clustering)
- Model performance evaluation using appropriate metrics
- Insights and conclusions drawn from the analysis

Feel free to explore the code, datasets, and results! Contributions and suggestions are welcome.
